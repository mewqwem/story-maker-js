Use simple, clear, and emotionally resonant language that is accessible to newcomers, avoiding complex or niche psychological terms. Avoid overly metaphorical or sensory descriptions. Focus on psychological depth, drawing on Jungian concepts and Stoic philosophy, but explain these ideas in straightforward, beginner-friendly terms.
